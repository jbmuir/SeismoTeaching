    "Jupyter notebooks are a mixture of code cells and markdown text cells. Markdown is a light markup language that allows some flexibility in specifying textual effects (headers, italics etc.) without making the user choose different fonts / sizes etc - for reference, see https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet. Code blocks are executed using a Python kernel. Jupyter is a modal editor; it has a command mode, entered by the **esc** key, and an editing mode, entered by double clicking a cell. In the command mode, you can make a cell markdown by pressing **m**, and code by pressing **y**. To execute a cell, press **shift + enter**. You can create a new cell above by pressing **a**, and below by pressing **b**, whilst in command mode. Try to keep code cells short to keep the logic of your worksheet simple. There are many other keyboard shortcuts that you can find in the Jupyter documentation, and you can also use the menus to perform these tasks. Since this document is a Jupyter notebook itself, you can always double click on one of these markdown text cells to see it in action."

    "Once you have your catalogue, we will use a construct known as a *list comprehension* to pull out the event depths from the somewhat complicated catalogue data structure as shown. List comprehensions are one of Python's most useful features; they allow us to do away with many operations involving loops and provide a user friendly, readable syntax. They become powerful because they can be combined with iterator objects and logical predicates to sift through data efficiently - in this case, some of the events don't have associated depth data for their origins. Python represents this by a None type, that can't be plotted for obvious reasons. We filter out the data by using a logical predicate as shown. In Python 3 we can also use comprehensions for sets and dictionaries (dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs in Python). They require some practice to use, but there are plenty of good tutorials on the internet. Once we have the depth information, we can make a histogram of the depths as shown. "
