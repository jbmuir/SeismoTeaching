### Introduction to Python as a Seismologic Tool
The purpose of this task is to familiarize yourself withsome of the tools used in modern observational seismology. Specifically, we will be learning the idioms of the modern python programming language (use of these idioms is known as "pythonic", one who understands them well is known as a "pythonista"), in the context of the obspy observational seismology package.D

The obspy package allows an efficient, repeatable workflow to be performed for the basic operations of observational seismology; searching for data, downloading, filtering, incorporation of metadata etc.

In order to use these tools, we must first obtain access to them. Most unix-based systems (Mac OS, Linux etc) will have access to a system installation of Python, but to avoid interfering with essential system tasks it is better to install our own. I recommend the anaconda python distribution.
