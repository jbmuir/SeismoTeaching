# Reflection - Jack Muir

I began this project with a fairly clear idea of what I wanted to accomplish - an introductory lab session that would combine basic skills in the seismological Python ecosystem, idiomatic usage of Python and geophysical insight.
I quickly determined that it was likely to be a "choose any 2 of 3" situation, with the length of the assignment ballooning out quickly.
In fact, I have most of a second assignment in draft form as a result of culling content from the final product.
Thankfully, taking this course had impressed upon me the importance of backwards design - hence I had the learning outcomes and types of assessment I wanted students to be able to achieve clearly in my mind throughout the process.
As a result, I think that this process of refinement was substantially less painful than it otherwise would have been.
Nevertheless, I found that even creating a relatively simple formative assessment task such as this one requires an investment in time that I could not have earlier foreseen.
I believe that I spent in excess of 10 hours ultimately, which is concordant with estimates in class of a 1:8 ratio of in-class activity to out-of-class preparation.

Ultimately, I decided that, being a seismology class & keeping in mind the importance of student motivation, in this case via a clear link to real world application, that I would limit the amount of "real" Python in the assignment, and instead that students would primarily have to interact only with a smaller subset of easier programming concepts.
This helped to keep the focus on the science, which I believe that students will appreciate.

I think that construction of this assignment helped me to meet my second and third personal learning outcomes (with the actual direction of a student lead learning experience in theory, at least).
The biggest takeaway for me was, when constructing course materials, creating a coherent set of design principles and sticking to them is essential.
I suppose that to a certain extent this is common sense, but as our readings in backwards design indicated the full realization of the importance of good design only sinks in once we attempt to create materials in practice.
As such, this project proved to be a very valuable learning experience.
